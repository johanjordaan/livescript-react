# livescript-react
This is a simple scaffold for using livescript with react and webpack.

I use no special loaders and I use the default babel react plugin.

The ls get transpiled to the build directory as js.
The js is then used for the webpack.

I like this very simple scaffold.

Please shout if it is useful to you.
