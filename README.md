# livescript-react
This is a simple scaffold for using livescript with react and webpack.

I use no special loaders and I use the default babel react plugin.

The ls get transpiled to the build directory as js.
The js is then used for the webpack.


To run the dev server simply run:

```npm run dev```

I like this very simple scaffold.

Please shout if it is useful to you.
